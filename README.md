Solution for question #6 using objects and functions

Original Question:

/**
 * #6 (STRETCH) Greatest Position Distance
 * --------------------
 * 1. Create a largish array of numbers, including at least two different
 *    numbers that repeat (e.g. 0, 2, 2, 7, 4, 1, 7, 8)
 * 2. Write a loop that finds the greatest position distance between
 *    repeating numbers in your array. In the above example, the 2's have
 *    a distance of 1, while the 7's have a distance of 3, so the
 *    greatest position distance for that array is 3.
 * 3. Output the array and its greatest position distance
 */


// Example output
// 5, 1, 8, 2, 9, 1, 4, 5, 0
// Greatest Position Distance: 7
